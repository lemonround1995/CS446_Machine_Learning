class LinearMRF(object):
    '''Class implementing the MRF used for denoising'''

    def __init__(self, width, height):
        '''Initializes the MRF model.

        Specifically, the model used is a grid graph, i.e. there is a
        node for every pixel in an image and a pair connecting every pair
        of adjacent pixels.

        The nodes are numbered sequentially, starting from the upper right
        corner of the image, first increasing to the right and then downward.
        For example, here are the numberings of the nodes of a 3x4 graph:
        0  1  2  3
        4  5  6  7
        8  9  10 11

        Pairs are represented as tuples (m, n), where m and n are the
        indices of the two nodes. For example, in the above graph,
        (5, 9) and (1, 2) are both pairs.

        After initialization, this class contains the following fields:
            width(int): the width in pixels of the images represented
            height(int): the height in pixels of the images represented
            unary_weight(tf.Variable): the linear weight for unary potentials
            pairwise_weight(tf.Variable): the linear weight for pairwise
                potentials
            pairs(list of tuples): represents the edges in the MRF. Each entry
                is a tuple containing two integers, each representing a node
            pair_inds(dict): provides the index within the list of pairs
                for a given pair
            neighbors(dict): the keys are nodes (integers), and the values
                are a list of integers representing the nodes adjacent to
                the specified node in the MRF
